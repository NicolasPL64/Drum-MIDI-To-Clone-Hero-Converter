# Drum MIDI to Clone Hero Chart converter

## What's changed in this fork?
- Changed the colors of the text labels for better readability (I think).
- Added an option to save the configurations in a file. You can drag and drop this file to the window to load them up again.
- Added support for ghost notes. You can now set a note velocity threshold if you want the program to automatically mark the notes whose velocities are under said threshold as ghosts. (You can disable it by setting the value to 0, which is the default).

PLEASE, report any issue you find related to the changes made in this fork only. Thanks.

## Original README
Converts MIDI files which contain drums to the Clone Hero Chart format to speed up drum charting.

Includes pro drums and automatic 2x kick processing.

Licence wise, do whatever you want with it, it didn't take long to make. If you do do something though I'd love to know just from curiosity!
